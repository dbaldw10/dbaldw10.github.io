    <h2>EXPERIENCE / PROJECTS </h2>
    <p>All of these repositories were built either in class, or after hours til the early morning after class each day.
        I spent quiet a few hours on the side scroller,
        and am proud to have introduced new concepts of level making.

    <h2> About Me</h2>
    <section id="AboutDallas">
        
        <p>I started fixing computers and software for teachers and classmates as a kid. When I grew up not a whole lot
            changed.
            Except, I began fixing bigger computers and eventually MRI machines. I've built databases, organized inventory
            for companies, and maintained websites that i've built
            for them. After being a Broker for Morris Loan and eventually leaving to take a direct interest in computer
            programming, I am posting my achievements in hopes to join
            a company with purpose, and to extend my tireless attitude toward a goal with a team like mindset.</p>
        <p>I have a very big interest in cryptocurrencies particularly in
            blockchain development. It seems that the world is trying to find the perfect balance of a perfectly written
            code to maintain the worlds financial structure, and
            a completely decentralized system, and its facisnating to say the least. Like if the perfect code was written,
            no one would have to touch it, and it could go on
            forever, and in effect be perpetually benefitting mankind.
