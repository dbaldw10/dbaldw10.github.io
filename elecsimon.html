    <p>Elec Simon has always taken care of his friends, family, and kids. Whether its in the Cleveland Cav's Arena during halftime, in the school gymnasium 
        giving a vunerable true life story, or in the parking lot helping 
        an old woman with her groceries, he has always done what he can for every person around him.

    <p>A humble country boy ohio start led Elec Simon to the big NY at a young age, and landed him a spotlight on the biggest Off Broadway Show in History, "Stomp". There he was apart
        of the cast for a decade, and currently takes parts in shows when needed. The Stomp family is always a family.

    <p>The excitement you see on stage, the stories you hear him tell, and the tattoos on his skin, all give you a clue into who Elec is. But nothing will let you get to know him,
        like when   you hear him laugh. Its unmistakeable, and bring a light to any person that hears it. And dont forget "If you fall down, get your mother fuckin ass up bitch."
